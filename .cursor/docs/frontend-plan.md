# Frontend Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building a React frontend for the existing FastAPI CRUD backend system with support for both Products and Users management.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18
- **Styling**: Base CSS (custom styles, no external UI libraries)
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch API or Axios
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast, modern alternative to Create React App)
- **Routing**: React Router (for navigation between Products/Users)
